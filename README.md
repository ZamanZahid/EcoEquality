# ðŸŒ± EcoEquality

EcoEquality brings together data from the CDC, EPA, and U.S. Census Bureau into a single, easy-to-use interactive map. Key features include a Social Vulnerability Index based on 16 CDC indicators, demographic insights on minority-majority counties from Census data, and the locations of both existing and proposed polluting facilities across the country. Users can explore proposed zoning changes and legislative bills that may impact their communities and take action using built-in toolsâ€”such as an AI-powered letter generatorâ€”to contact local representatives directly.
